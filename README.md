### Hi, I'm Chris 👋👨‍💻

I am a software engineer currently working at Minna Technologies. My belief is that software is one of many tools that can empower 💪 people 🧑🏿‍🤝‍🧑🏻 to solve almost any problem.
However we are in the middle of a time with a lot of uncertainity. Absurd fragmentation of programming languages and ecosystem tools, a huge lack of mathematic and scientific formal principles and ignorance of program correctness. I know we can do better (✂️💩) and when we finally do, it is going to be awesome! 🌈

#### So what do I suggest that we should focus more on?
- Category Theory
- Functional Programming λ🦄
- Formal Verification
- Pure functional languages: Haskell, Elm, PureScript, Idris, Unison
- Dependent Types
- Erlang/BEAM/OTP (Resilience/Fault Tolerance/Scalability)
- Visual programming: Enso (formerly Luna)

#### What should we focus less on?
- Java
- JavaScript
- Go
- Python
- Dynamic Typing
- Mainstream Hype
